## UsagePull requests
><b>Add a note:</b> Fill in the title and body, then hit the floppy disk save icon.
>> You will see your note saved in the left side column.
>> 
>> Hitting the '+' instead if the floppy disk will send your note into oblivian 🧙‍ (won't fix)

> To view an existing note you simply click on it from the left coolumn.

> The '+' is for switching from viewing an existing note to creating a new one.

><b>Delete a note:</b> Hit the red trashcan icon on an existing note. (or the + on the one you're currently writing 🤦‍♂️)  

### Technical Jargon

This application uses an Express.js back-end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

I wrote the back-end `JavaScript`, connected the front-end, and then deployed the application to Heroku.

> Application front end connects to an `Express.js` back end.

> Application back end stores notes with unique IDs in a `JSON` file.

> Application is deployed to `Heroku`.
