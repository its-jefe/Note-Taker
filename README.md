Write, save, and delete notes! 

Deployed on [Heroku][1]! 

Front-end starter code from [Xandromus][2]

## Description
This application uses an Express.js back-end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

I wrote the back-end, connected the front-end, and then deployed the application to Heroku.

> Application front end connects to an Express.js back end.
